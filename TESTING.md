## User testing 
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any feedback and possible way of improving it. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience, especially regarding the styling. 

It was through this testing that the following changes were made:
- Assessing the combinations of colours and the related contrast.
- Fonts choice looking smart and not invasive.
- Overall balance in the positioning and sizing of elements in the pages.

### Bugs found during the testing phase

Bug no. | Bug description |  Bug fix |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | 
1 | Removing the insecure default Django key | After doing so i kept having issues running the server locally. Tutor support pointed me in the right direction regarding a set up mistake.
2 | Requirements.txt | Due to a gitpod upgrade it filled up automatically with many unecessary packages intalled. Besides that i had to install them again every time i started the workpsace. Tutors and Slack advices pointed me in the right direction to fix the issue.
3 | A few external links would not open in another tab | Problem solved by adding <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute to the anchor tags.
4 | Python code issues| A fair amount of time has been spent at the end of the project to make the PY code PEP8 compliant.

### Security Features Considered

#### General
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for the Heroku App.
- Use of <code>.gitignore</code> to hide all secret keys.
- Only the default DJANGO insecure key has been initially pushed to Github. Later on, after delploying onto heroku, a new secure key has been generated, inserted into the env.py file which has been as well secured from pushing thanks to the .gitignore file.
The reasons why the unsafe default django key has been initially pushed onto the repository are:
   - Following the Boutique-Ado tutorials the key gets initially committed and then changed later towards the end of the project.
   - I was experiencing issues in removing the key initially and running the server locally. Therefore I decided to proceed with the project and I have asked for help from the tutors later.
   - Being insecure by default it had to be changed regardless.
#### App
- Only the <strong>Website owner/Admin</strong> has some privileges, such as:
  - Add/Edit/Remove products.
  - Delete users.
  - Change privileges to the registered users.
